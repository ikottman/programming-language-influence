JavaScript,JavaScript (JS) is an interpreted computer programming language.  It was originally implemented as part of web browsers so that client-side scripts could interact with the user control the browser communicate asynchronously and alter the document content that was displayed.  JavaScript is a prototype-based scripting language that is dynamic weakly typed and has first-class functions. Its syntax was influenced by the language C.,475686,CoffeeScript,http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/JavaScript-logo.png,http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/JavaScript-logo.png
Ruby,Ruby is a dynamic reflective general-purpose object-oriented programming language that combines syntax inspired by Perl with Smalltalk-like features. It was also influenced by Eiffel and Lisp. Ruby was first designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro Matz Matsumoto in Japan. Ruby supports multiple programming paradigms including functional object oriented and imperative.,385618,Groovy,http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Ruby_logo.svg/200px-Ruby_logo.svg.png,http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Ruby_logo.svg
Java,Java is a general-purpose concurrent class-based object-oriented computer programming language that is specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once run anywhere (WORA) meaning that code that runs on one platform does not need to be recompiled to run on another. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture.,301864,C Sharp|Clojure|Groovy|JavaScript|PHP|Python|Scala,http://vector4u.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/java_logo.jpg,http://vector4u.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/java_logo.jpg
PHP,PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language. PHP is now installed on more than 244 million websites and 2.1 million web servers. Originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1995 the reference implementation of PHP is now produced by The PHP Group. While PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page it is now said to stand for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor a recursive acronym.,230245,NULL,http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/PHP-logo.svg/200px-PHP-logo.svg.png,http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/PHP-logo.svg
Python,Python is a general-purpose high-level programming language whose design philosophy emphasizes code readability.

C,In computing C is a general-purpose programming language initially developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at AT&T Bell Labs. Like most imperative languages in the ALGOL tradition C has facilities for structured programming and allows lexical variable scope and recursion while a static type system prevents many unintended operations. C program source code is free-format using the semicolon as a statement terminator and curly braces for grouping blocks of statements.,127358,C++|C Sharp|Go|JavaScript|Java|Objective-C|PHP|Perl,http://www.unixstickers.com/image/cache/data/stickers/C/C.sh-600x600.png,http://www.unixstickers.com/image/cache/data/stickers/C/C.sh-600x600.png
Objective-C,Objective-C is a general-purpose high-level object-oriented programming language that adds Smalltalk-style messaging to the C programming language. It is the main programming language used by Apple for the OS X and iOS operating systems and their respective APIs Cocoa and Cocoa Touch. Originally developed in the early 1980s it was selected as the main language used by NeXT for its NeXTSTEP operating system from which OS X and iOS are derived.,67734,Java,http://stunit.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/objective-c-logo.jpg,http://stunit.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/objective-c-logo.jpg
C Sharp,C# (pronounced see sharp) is a multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing imperative declarative functional generic object-oriented and component-oriented programming disciplines. It was developed by Microsoft within its . NET initiative and later approved as a standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) and ISO . C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure.,65232,Java,http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/C_Sharp_wordmark.svg/200px-C_Sharp_wordmark.svg.png,http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/C_Sharp_wordmark.svg
Perl,Perl is a high-level general-purpose interpreted dynamic programming language. Though Perl is not officially an acronym there are various backronyms in use such as: Practical Extraction and Reporting Language. Perl was originally developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a general-purpose Unix scripting language to make report processing easier. Since then it has undergone many changes and revisions. The latest major stable revision is 5.16 released in May 2012.,29981,JavaScript|PHP|Perl|Python|Ruby,http://warpedreality.org/images/logos/perl.gif,http://warpedreality.org/images/logos/perl.gif

Groovy,Groovy is an object-oriented programming language for the Java platform. It is a dynamic language with features similar to those of Python Ruby Perl and Smalltalk. It can be used as a scripting language for the Java Platform is dynamically compiled to Java Virtual Machine (JVM) bytecode and interoperates with other Java code and libraries. Groovy uses a Java-like bracket syntax. Most Java code is also syntactically valid Groovy.,6601,NULL,http://groovy.codehaus.org/images/groovy-logo-medium.png,http://groovy.codehaus.org/images/groovy-logo-medium.png
