JavaScript,JavaScript (JS) is an interpreted computer programming language. #invoke:Footnotessfn It was originally implemented as part of web browsers so that client-side scripts could interact with the user control the browser communicate asynchronously and alter the document content that was displayed. #invoke:Footnotessfn JavaScript is a prototype-based scripting language that is dynamic weakly typed and has first-class functions. Its syntax was influenced by the language C.,475686,ActionScript|CoffeeScript|Dart|JScript .NET|Objective-J|QML|TypeScript,http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Javascript_icon.svg/200px-Javascript_icon.svg.png,http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Javascript_icon.svg
Ruby,Ruby is a dynamic reflective general-purpose object-oriented programming language that combines syntax inspired by Perl with Smalltalk-like features. It was also influenced by Eiffel and Lisp.

Java,Java is a general-purpose concurrent class-based object-oriented computer programming language that is specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once run anywhere (WORA) meaning that code that runs on one platform does not need to be recompiled to run on another. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture.,301864,Ada|BeanShell|C Sharp|Clojure|D|ECMAScript|Groovy|J Sharp|JavaScript|PHP|Python|Scala|Seed7|Vala,http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Java_logo.svg/200px-Java_logo.svg.png,http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Java_logo.svg
PHP,PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language. PHP is now installed on more than 244 million websites and 2.1 million web servers. Originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1995 the reference implementation of PHP is now produced by The PHP Group.

C++,C++ (pronounced see plus plus) is a statically typed free-form multi-paradigm compiled general-purpose programming language. It is regarded as an intermediate-level language as it comprises a combination of both high-level and low-level language features. Developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs C++ was originally named C with Classes adding object oriented features such as classes and other enhancements to the C programming language.,140501,Ada|C99|C Sharp|D|Falcon|Java|LPC|Lua|PHP|Perl|Pike|Seed7,http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/C_plus_plus_book.jpg/200px-C_plus_plus_book.jpg,http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/C_plus_plus_book.jpg
C,In computing C is a general-purpose programming language initially developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at AT&T Bell Labs. Like most imperative languages in the ALGOL tradition C has facilities for structured programming and allows lexical variable scope and recursion while a static type system prevents many unintended operations. C program source code is free-format using the semicolon as a statement terminator and curly braces for grouping blocks of statements.,127358,AMPL|AWK|BitC|C++|C--|C Sharp|C shell|D|Go|JavaScript|Java|LPC|Limbo|Objective-C|PHP|Perl|Pike|Processing|Seed7,"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/The_C_Programming_Language,_First_Edition_Cover_(2).svg/200px-The_C_Programming_Language,_First_Edition_Cover_(2).svg.png","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/The_C_Programming_Language,_First_Edition_Cover_(2).svg"

Objective-C,Objective-C is a general-purpose high-level object-oriented programming language that adds Smalltalk-style messaging to the C programming language. It is the main programming language used by Apple for the OS X and iOS operating systems and their respective APIs Cocoa and Cocoa Touch. Originally developed in the early 1980s it was selected as the main language used by NeXT for its NeXTSTEP operating system from which OS X and iOS are derived.,67734,Java|Nu|Objective-J|TOM (object-oriented programming language),NULL,NULL
